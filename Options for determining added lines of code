Options for determining added lines of code


- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2528111/how-can-i-calculate-the-number-of-lines-changed-between-two-commits-in-git
	-- git diff --numstat <commit 1> <commit 2> provides lines added and removed between commits (numbers) for a given file
	-- one step ahead of using JGit because I will have the hashes I want to compare and the counts will be done for me; just need to store and add new value each time repo is reverted

	analyze then revert until at first commit (newHash) --> oldHash is previous so want to diff new and old until there is no new?



- JGit (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19467305/using-the-jgit-how-can-i-retrieve-the-line-numbers-of-added-deleted-lines)
	-- DiffFormater (already using) can return only lines added and removed (think I'm already doing this too)
	-- could parse and count each line, but requires some overhead to loop (not much memory, but time)
